# Login Page Test Project

This project is a test implementation of a login page using **Next.js**, showcasing modern React patterns and state management approaches.

## Features

- Login form with **React Hook Form** and **Zod** validation
- Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) flow
- API handling using **React Query**
- Includes some original **Redux** and **RTK Query** code for reference

## Technical Choices

Initially, the project was implemented using **Redux** and **RTK Query** due to an early misunderstanding of the requirements. After reviewing them, RTK Query was replaced with **React Query** to better align with the project needs. The original Redux and RTK Query code has been retained, allowing the project to also demonstrate my experience with **Redux** and **Redux Toolkit Query**.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – React framework for server-side rendering and routing
- **React Query** – For API data fetching and state management
- **Redux & Redux Toolkit Query** – Partially retained for demonstration
- **React Hook Form + Zod** – Form state management and validation
- **Axios** – HTTP requests
- **Tailwind CSS** – Styling

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
