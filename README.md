# 🔑 Login Page Test

A simple **Next.js 15** login page project built with **React 19**, **Tailwind CSS 4**, and **Redux Toolkit**.  
It includes authentication form validation, and a clean modern UI.

## 📝 Note from the Developer

Initially, I planned to implement more advanced **server-side features**, but to keep the project lightweight and focused, I decided to keep the API routes simple and straightforward.  
For the UI, I used **shadcn/ui** components to speed up development while keeping the design consistent and modern.
